# Introduction

- Ansible is an **open-source Configuration Management and Deployment tool**, maintained by Red Hat.  
- The main components of Ansible are **playbooks, configuration management, and deployment**.  
- Ansible uses **playbooks** to deploy, manage, build, test, and configure anything from full server environments to custom compiled source code for applications.  
- Ansible is written in **Python**.

# Configuration Tasks

Configuration can be any task performed on servers (hosts), such as:

1. Install / Update / Uninstall software (packages)  
2. Copy files and change permissions on files or directories  
3. Start / Stop / Restart services  
4. Create / Delete users

# Various Configuration Management Tools

- Ansible  
- Chef  
- Puppet  
- SaltStack

# Ansible Features

- Agentless configuration using **SSH**  
- Built on Python â†’ provides Python functionality  
- **YAML-based Playbooks**  
- Uses **push-based** architecture  

### Push vs Pull  
- **Pull based (Puppet, Chef):** Agent on server periodically pulls configuration from Master.  
- **Push based (Ansible):** Central server pushes configuration to target servers. You control when changes are applied.

# Host Inventory

Ansible inventory defines the hosts (machines) that Ansible manages.  

### Key Points
- Comments â†’ `#`  
- Blank lines ignored  
- Groups â†’ `[groupname]`  
- Hosts can belong to multiple groups  
- Ungrouped hosts listed before any groups
